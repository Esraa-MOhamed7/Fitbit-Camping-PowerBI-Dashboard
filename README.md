# Fitbit Campaign Dashboard in Power BI

## Project Overview

This project features a comprehensive marketing analytics dashboard built in Power BI, using real-world data from a Fitbit advertising campaign. The goal was to provide a dual-faceted view of performance, focusing on both the marketing campaign’s effectiveness and the customer’s behavior.

The project was completed as part of the training program at the National Telecommunication Institute (NTI).

## Tools and Techniques

- **Power BI**: The primary tool for data cleaning, modeling, and visualization.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used to create custom measures for key performance indicators (KPIs).
- **Data Cleaning & Modeling**: Performed to prepare the raw data for analysis and build a robust data model.
- **Data Visualization Best Practices**: Applied to create clear, impactful, and easily understandable dashboards.

## Dashboards Highlights

The project consists of two interactive dashboards, each with a distinct focus:

### 1. Dashboard 1: Marketing Overview

This dashboard provides a high-level view of the campaign’s performance, tracking the following KPIs and visuals:

- **KPIs**: Total Impressions, Click-Through Rate (CTR), Total Clicks, Conversion Rate (CR), and Total Conversions.
- **Visuals**:
    - Performance Over Time (Impressions vs Conversions)
    - Conversions by Country
    - Conversion Value by Product Category
    - Conversions by Gender
- **Features**: Includes interactive slicers for a dynamic filtering experience.

### 2. Dashboard 2: Customer Insights

This dashboard dives deeper into customer behavior and demographics:

- **KPIs**: Total Customers, Average Conversion Value.
- **Visuals**:
    - Customers by Gender (Donut Chart)
    - Conversions by Ad Platform
    - Impressions vs Conversions by Age Group
- **Features**: Dynamic slicers for filtering by Age Group and Country.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

The analysis of the dashboards led to several actionable insights and strategic recommendations:

1.  **Platform Optimization**:
    - **Insight**: Platforms like Google delivered the highest conversions, while others (e.g., “X”) underperformed.
    - **Recommendation**: Consider reallocating the ad budget from underperforming platforms to those with higher returns to maximize efficiency.

2.  **Targeting Strategy**:
    - **Insight**: The 25–34 age group showed the highest engagement and conversion rates.
    - **Recommendation**: Future campaigns should be specifically tailored to this ideal target audience.

3.  **Customer Demographics**:
    - **Insight**: The distribution of male and female customers is nearly balanced, with other genders also contributing.
    - **Recommendation**: This highlights the impact of inclusive marketing and the importance of maintaining a broad targeting approach.

4.  **Product Focus**:
    - **Insight**: Smartphones lead significantly in conversion value.
    - **Recommendation**: Emphasize smartphones in future ad creatives and campaigns to capitalize on the high return on investment (ROI).

5.  **Geographic Targeting**:
    - **Insight**: Countries like Canada and Australia showed stronger conversion performance.
    - **Recommendation**: These regions represent potential markets to focus on for maximum ROI.

## Project Deliverables

- **Dashboard Images**: Screenshots of both the Marketing Overview and Customer Insights dashboards.
